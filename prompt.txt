I am attaching two csv files: 
1:"codprov.csv", containing spain provinces ('CODIGO': code according to INE, spain institute of statistics';LITERAL':name). 
2:"iso3166_2_es_prov.csv", containing ISO 3166-2 codes of the same provinces ('cod 3166-2': iso code, 	'nombre': province name). 
Could you create a table with the relation of INE code, and ISO code, and name for each province. 
Take into account that may have differences in the names on each csv, capitals and maybe other symbols.
